# crypto_wallet
Hi!

I present you a virtual crypto wallet.
It's purpose is rather obvious. You will be able to create, update, delete, and keep track of your own coins!

In order for it to properly work, you will need Vagrant, ruby v2.4.4 and rails v5.2.0
(Vagrant you'd have to download and install on your machine, however for ruby and rails you could just bundle install through Git Bash)

Thanks!
